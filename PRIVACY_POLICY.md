# Privacy Policy for SkinScanner ðŸ”Ž

**Effective Date:** April 27, 2025

Welcome to SkinScanner! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the SkinScanner browser extension ("SkinScanner", "we", "us") handles and how it's used.

## 1. Information Handled Locally

To provide a functional and personalized experience, SkinScanner stores certain settings and preferences directly on your computer using your browser's local storage (`browser.storage.local` or `chrome.storage.local`). This information includes:

*   **Search Parameters:** Your last used item name, exterior selection, float range values, and paint seed/pattern input.
*   **Marketplace Selections:** Which marketplaces you have selected for searching.
*   **UI Preferences:** Settings such as your preference for Dark Mode.

**Key Points:**
*   This data is stored **only on your local device**.
*   We **do not collect or store any Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** such as your name, email address, IP address, or specific browsing history outside of the inputs you provide directly to the extension.
*   The extension **does not transmit** this locally stored data to any external servers controlled by us or third parties.

## 2. How Locally Stored Information is Used

The information stored locally is used solely to:

*   **Persist your settings:** So you don't have to re-enter your preferences every time you open the extension popup.
*   **Improve user experience:** By remembering your last search criteria and UI choices.

## 3. Outbound Links and Tracking Parameters

When you perform a search using SkinScanner, the extension generates direct links to third-party marketplace websites based on your selected criteria.

*   **Referral Links:** Some of these links may include referral codes (e.g., `ref=...`, `aff=...`). If you make a purchase or interact with the marketplace after clicking such a link, the extension developer (Dadscap) might receive a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps support the development and maintenance of SkinScanner.
*   **UTM Parameters:** To understand general usage patterns (like which marketplaces are most frequently searched *from* the extension) and to help attribute traffic originating from SkinScanner, we may add standard, non-personal UTM tracking parameters (such as `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`) to the generated URLs.
    *   **These UTM parameters identify SkinScanner as the source of the visit.**
    *   They **do not** include your specific search inputs (like item name, floats, paint seed) or any personal information.
    *   This data is sent directly from your browser to the destination marketplace when you click the link and is processed according to that marketplace's own privacy policy.

## 4. Data Security

Data stored locally via `browser.storage.local` is secured by your browser's built-in security mechanisms.

## 5. Third-Party Websites

SkinScanner provides links to external websites (marketplaces). This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any marketplace you visit. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external sites.

## 6. Managing Your Data

You have control over the locally stored data:

*   **Clearing Data:** You can typically clear data stored by extensions through your browser's settings (look for options related to "Cookies and Site Data" or specific extension data management).
*   **Uninstalling:** Uninstalling the SkinScanner extension will remove all associated locally stored data.

## 7. Children's Privacy

SkinScanner is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the effective date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the SkinScanner extension after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
